1998-09-01  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* hmouse-br.el (smart-br): When displaying a listing entry for editing
    based on a mouse click, leave point in the listing window.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-make-htables): Send /R option to MS-DOS sort
    command, not -r, and produce clear message if this option is not
    handled by the sort command invoked under MS OSes.

1998-08-28  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-menu.el (br-menu-update-env-list): Added to produce dynamic Env name
    menu under GNU Emacs.  InfoDock and XEmacs do this via the :filter
    keyword.

* br-env.el (br-env-copy): Added "env-start-build-time" and
    "env-end-build-time".

* br.el (br-mode): 
        (br-mode-map): Moved popup menu setup from br-menu.el to here.

* br-tree.el (br-tree-load): Added 'mswindows symbol for XEmacs on NT.

* hmouse-br.el (smart-element): Allow for optional double quotes around
    feature file pathnames.
  br-*-ft.el (*-output-feature-tags): Called prin1 to update the pathname
    location of each set of tags to avoid read errors on MS OSes.

* br-menu.el (br-menu-common-body): Added 3-Button-Mouse option.
  br-start.el (br-two-button-mouse): 
	      (br-three-button-mouse): 
  br-site.el (br-setup-mouse-keys): Added to bind the Action Key to the
    middle or left mouse button in OO-Browser listing buffers, for
    easier viewing of listing items.

1998-08-27  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-menu.el: Updated so that when loaded, adds a menubar entry for
    invoking the OO-Browser under XEmacs and GNU Emacs.  InfoDock
    automatically adds such an entry under its Software menu.

* br-env.el (br-env-stats): Print language type of the current Environment 
    on the first line of (br-env-stats) output.

* br-start.el (featurep 'info): Replaced wrong 'Info symbol.

* br.el (br-mode-map): Rebound {C-c C-c} from (br-env-create) to
    (br-env-browse) since the former can no longer be called
    interactively.

1998-08-26  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el (br-env-copy): Protected `set' calls with `boundp' tests
    to eliminate possibility of unbound variable value references.

* br-lib.el (br-real-build-al): Skip symlink subdirectories.  This can
    help prevent infinite recursions caused by circular links found within
    some code trees.  If any code lives within another tree, the
    Environment can include its root directory.


* br.el (br-add-class-file): Removed since would not work properly and full
    Environment rebuilding is fast enough now.  In the future, incremental
    Environment rebuilding may be supported.

1998-08-25  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-mode-map): Added key bindings within listing buffers for Env
    name commands.

* br-lib.el (br-abbreviate-file-name): Added this function to deal with
    XEmacs / GNU Emacs calling incompatibilities in abbreviate-file-name.

1998-08-24  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-menu.el (br-menu-common-body): Removed Rebuild-Lib-Part,
    Rebuild-Sys-Part since are seldom used.  Added Env name handling
    items.

* br-env.el (br-env-cond-build): Since this is always called from
    br-env-load, eliminate load of Environment from its call to
    br-env-build.

* *-browse.el (*-browse): Fixed non-refresh of browser display when bring
    a different Environment back in from memory (since br-env-load is
    not called in such instances).

1998-08-23  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* hasht.el (hash-delete): Fixed to truly remove a key from the hash-table.

* br-env.el (br-env-create): Deleted unneeded interactive calling spec.

* br.el (br-next-buffer): Set title bar in browser listing buffers to
    show are in the OO-Browser and what the current Environment is.

* br-name.el:
  br-env.el: Added and updated to support browsing Environments by a
    mnemonic name rather than by file name.  Also added menu of Env names
    under InfoDock.

1998-08-22  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* hasht.el (hash-empty-p): Added.

1998-08-21  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-at): Eliminated narrowing to class to conform to the way
    other commands work.

* br-site.el: Fixed to deal with python-mode keymap being named py-mode-map.

* br-clos-ft.el (clos-element-tag-list): Modified to output listing entry
    components within tags just like other languages.  Also modified to
    mark constant and variable tags with `=' prefixes.

* eif-calls.el (eif-insert-class-info-calls): Fixed so works automatically 
    when called from `br-entry-info'.

* br-eif-ft.el (eif-locate-feature): 
  eif-calls.el (eif-routine-regexp): 
	       (eif-routine-to-regexp): Added support for multiple name
    routine definitions. 

1998-08-20  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-scan-features-in-class): Added support for enums,
    typedefs, structs and unions embedded within classes.  Each such
    construct is listed together with its class of occurrence within
    the C construct default class instances.  Each attribute named
    at the end of each such construct (even multiple attributes per line)
    are added to the class' feature list.

* br-ftr.el (br-etags-file): Renamed from br-tags-file to reduce any
    confusion with OO-Browser feature tags (these are Emacs TAGS file
    tags).

* Redesigned all feature handling code to speed feature queries.
  Using a test Environment of 586 C++ classes on a Pentium II 350 Mhz
  Linux system, generating a listing of all Environment features
  (9859 entries including classes) went from 15 seconds in V3.07 to 1.5
  seconds for a 10-fold speedup.

  A user-visible side-effect of this speedup under MS operating systems
  only (due to their lack of the -d option to their builtin sort function),
  is that features are alphabetized by category, e.g. regular methods in one
  group, special methods in other groups, followed by attributes.

1998-08-19  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-feature): Deleted optional ARG since would not work any more.

1998-08-18  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-type-modifier-keyword):
	       (c++-type-def-modifier): Added `unsigned'.
	       (c++-attribute-decl): Adapted to support enum, struct, and
    union as class attributes.

1998-08-17  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-tree.el (br-tree-do-cmd): Fixed so features may be viewed or edited
    just like classes.  (Before they could be viewed only.)

* br.el (br-implementors): Fixed comparison problem in filtering out entries from
    default classes like `[constant]'.

1998-08-16  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-python-ft.el (python-feature-signature-to-name): Eliminated invalid
    call to `python-feature-add-prefix'.
	
1998-08-15  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-list-implementors): Eliminated sort of
    implementors since is complex, time-consuming and is handled
    elsewhere before implementors are displayed.
            (br-feature-tags-delete): Renamed from br-delete-features and
    moved from "br-lib.el".

* br-lib.el (br-features-htable): 
	(br-feature-paths-htable): Added these 2 variable definitions.
  br-ftr.el (br-feature-build-htables): Renamed from `br-feature-tags-save'
    and added code to create feature htables for faster lookup.
            (br-feature-make-htables): Added.
  br-env.el (br-env-load): Modified to not rebuild children-htable since
    this is recreated from the children-alist saved in any modern Environment.
            (br-env-save): Removed conditional copy of `br-feature-tags-file'
    since this was replaced by alists stored in the main Environment file.

* hasht.el (hash-make-prepend): 
	   (hash-prepend): Added to allow addition of entries to a value
    list referenced by key.

1998-08-14  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-browse): Removed call to raise-frame to allow user to control
    this behavior.

* Changed \^M everywhere to more modern \r syntax and added \r where
  needed to support MS OS usage of \r\n to end lines.

1998-08-13  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-scan-features-in-class): Pure virtual functions were
    being ignored like regular function declarations, so they were not
    added to the features list.  Fixed.

==============================================================================
* V4.00 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

1998-08-04  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* *-brows*.el (*-browse): Under same-env conditional, move *-browse-setup
	  to follow br-env-copy call to that br-env-file is set properly
	prior to br-setup-constants reference of it.
  br-lib.el (br-setup-constants): Added call to `br-init' or OOBR-FTR
    would not be set correctly when switched languages to a cached
    language Environment.

==============================================================================
* V3.07 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

1998-08-02  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el (br-env-load): Do a refresh on all browser windows after
    loading environment if this function was called interactively.
    Otherwise, may be displaying old Environment information.
	
* br-env.el (br-env-read-file-name): Fix problem where `dir' was set to a
    filename rather than a directory.  This prevented proper
    completion when br-env-browse is called interactively.
            (br-env-browse): Modified interactive call to complete in
    current directory and to prompt with an Env name in the current
    directory rather than with `br-env-file' since this is
    typically called from `oo-browser' which has already prompted the
    user whether to reuse the current Environment.

* br.el (br-ancestors): Fixed so when called by br-routines, br-attributes 
    or br-features and not on a class, will display an error message.

* br-compl.el (br-find-class-name-as-list): Added and used to eliminate
    creation of a '(nil) list if point is not on a class name.

* br.el (br-where): Modified to always include the class name within the
    output.

* br-eif-ft.el (eif-tag-fields-regexp): Added.  Needed by br-ftr.el.
               (eif-feature-signature-to-name): Changed to use "::" rather 
    than "," separator for compatibility with generic OO-Browser functions.

1998-08-01  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el (br-env-load): Obsoleted Eiffel Environments earlier than
    03.06.01.
            (br-env-rebuild): Added refresh of the OO-Browser display
    after rebuild.

* br-compl.el (br-find-class-name): Fixed so returns nil if on a feature
    entry line.

* br-eif.el (eif-set-case): Modified to simply return its argument rather
    than downcasing it.

* eif-calls.el (eif-reserved-words-htable): Added to speed reserved word
     comparisons.
  br-eif.el (eif-get-parents-from-source): 
  br-eif-ft.el (eif-keyword-p): Modified to use above variable.

* eif-calls.el (eif-store-class-info-calls): Removed downcase call.
  br-eif-ft.el (eif-find-class-name): 
	       (eif-renamed-feature-p): 
  eif-calls.el (eif-get-class-name-from-source): 
  br-eif.el (eif-get-parents-from-source): 
    	    (eif-get-classes-from-source): Removed (eif-set-case class)
    call so that class names are stored and matched against as found in
    the source.

* eif-ise-er.el (eif-ise-compilation-parse-errors): Eliminated duplicative 
    downcase of `class-name'.

* br-eif.el (eif-get-classes-from-source): 
	    (eif-get-parents-from-source): Rewrote to conform to newer
    file processing techniques.

* eif-calls.el (eif-parse-attributes): Simplified and corrected by calling 
    br-member.  This eliminated a potential parsing hang.

Wed Jul 15 13:05:25 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-compl.el (br-buffer-menu-file-name): Renamed from
    br-buffer-menu-buffer-name and rewrote to return the file name
    for comparison rather than the buffer name.  Eliminates problems
    with buffer names like foo.java<2>.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-tag-signature): Removed reference to
    language-specific c++-tag-fields-regexp.

* br.el (br-where): Added missing regexp-quote to br-feature-tag-and-file call.

1998-07-14  Bob Weiner <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-compl.el (br-buffer-menu): Changed arg to `t' for XEmacs-compatibility.

==============================================================================
* V3.06.01 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Thu Jun 11 00:24:14 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-*-ft.el (*-list-features): Removed nreverse call since was reversing
    same named features when it should have left them alone.

* br-lib.el (br-insert-file-contents): Removed 2nd arg to
    insert-file-contents which caused *br-tmp-buffer*' to become
    associated with the last file scanned.  Since this buffer is
    not killed, when one would view an entry from this file, the
    *br-tmp-buffer* would improperly be used.

* br-python-ft.el (python-get-file-buffer): Deleted, call
   br-insert-file-contents instead.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-list-attributes): Modified to do a regexp search.
            (br-attribute-type-regexp): 
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-add-prefix): List static attributes with an "& "
    prefix instead of an "= ".

* br-env.el (br-env-stats): Extended to include editor and OS information
    for use when troubleshooting.

Wed Jun 10 22:31:05 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-at-feature-regexp): 
               (c++-routine-prefix-in-class): Allow for :: scoping
    operators in argument lists.
               (c++-feature-view-declaration): After use br-find-class to
    match to a specific class, limit feature searches to the body of that
    class; this prevents a bug when looking for constructors that could
    match to a feature scoped to the current class with a completely
    different feature name (only the part preceding the :: is matched in
    this case (the class name was improperly treated as the constructor
    name)).
               (c++-feature-method-display): 
	       (c++-feature-view-declaration): 
	       (c++-feature-attribute-display): Made match searches
    case-sensitive.

* br-c++.el (c++-parent-regexp): Fixed overrun in parent scan when
    processing conditionalized class headers like:

      #ifdef DEFINE
      class myclass : public yourparent
      #else
      class myclass : public myparent
      #endif
      {}

    by adding # as a terminator character.

Tue Jun  2 15:36:44 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-java.el: Added (require 'br-c-ft).
  br-java-ft.el (java-add-default-classes): Added call to
    `c-add-default-classes' to support Java/C integration.

1998-06-02  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-declaration-regexp): Fixed bug that could
    produce the wrong regexp when definition signature contained newlines.

==============================================================================
* V3.06 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Thu May 28 14:27:09 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-menu.el (br-menu-common-body): Added Use-Vi-as-Editor menu toggle item.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-found-p): 
  br-lib.el (br-find-class): Modified to return the line number at which
    the entry displayed begins.
            (br-line-number): Added.
  br.el (br-view): Rewrote to display classes with external
    viewers/editors at their exact starting line.
        (br-feature): Rewrote to display elements with external
    viewers/editors at their exact starting line.

* br.el (br-edit-ext): Removed concat of an integer.
        (br-edit-ext-start): 
	(br-view-ext-start): Simplified by using a call to `apply'.
    Also set window manager title to the file being displayed if "xterm"
    is the command called; this typically means vi is being used.
        (br-edit-externally-p): Added to allow external editing of elements.

1998-05-19  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-map-class-tags): 
	        (objc-feature-map-tags): 
		(objc-list-categories): 
  br-python-ft.el (python-feature-map-class-tags): 
  br-java-ft.el (java-feature-map-class-tags): 
		(java-feature-map-tags): 
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-map-class-tags): 
               (c++-feature-map-tags): 
	       (c++-list-features): Fixed bug that locally bound
    case-fold-search before setting the current buffer (which has its own
    value).

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-attribute-modifier-keyword): Added support for arrays.
               (c++-routine-prefix-in-class): 
               (c++-routine-in-class): Added these two constants for use
    in eliminating routine declarations while scanning class features;
    this eliminates false attribute matches to routine argument declarations.
               (c++-scan-features-in-class): Modified to delete routine
    declarations from the scan.

* br-*-ft.el (*-get-feature-tags): Renamed to *-output-feature-tags,
    made 2nd arg non-optional and eliminated conditional that scanned
    the source since this was never called to read the features; it was
    always passed a list of features.

1998-05-15  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-get-feature-tags): 
  br-c++.el (c++-get-classes-from-source): Removed feature sort to speed up.
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-to-end): Remove testing of whether in a
    comment or not to speed up this often called function.

  Made the same changes for other languages.

  The combination of these improvements sped up C++ Environment building
  6-fold under InfoDock and XEmacs and a 14-fold speedup under GNU Emacs! 

==============================================================================
* V3.05 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================
	
1998-05-07  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-clos-ft.el (clos-feature-locate-p): Eliminated null signature bug.

Thu May  7 00:00:37 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-tree.el (*br-tree-prog-name*):
             (br-tree-load): Handle that newer versions of GNU Emacs set
    window-system to w32 under Windows.

* br-ftr.el (require 'br-c-ft): Added since it `br-feature-tags-save'
    references its function `c-build-element-tags'.

Wed May  6 01:58:56 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el:
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-scan-features): 
  br-c-ft.el (c-build-element-tags-internal): 
  br-c-tags (tags_file): Renamed OO-Browser-specific tags generator to
    `ootags' from `etags', so it can co-exist with old versions of etags.

* Make-Env (oo-browser-env): Renamed from oobr-env.
           (oo-browser-env-debug): Renamed from oobr-env-debug.

* hasht.el (hash-merge-first-value): Added.
  br-lib.el (br-merge-parents-htables): 
	    (br-get-htable): Called this new function.

Sun May  3 22:04:42 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-lib.el (br-build-paths-htable): We may have merged two tables where a
    single class-name was referenced in one and defined in the other which
    means it will have both a path entry and a br-null-path entry; remove
    the latter.  This fixes a bug where {M-e} br-env-stats shows a class
    as undefined when it is not.
            (br-delete-sorted-strings):
            (br-merge-paths-htables): Added to support this merging.

* hasht.el (hash-merge): Make the merged hash-table be 20% larger than the
    number of entries filled in all hash-tables to be merged, so that
    hash misses are minimized.
           (hash-make): Signal an error if sent a floating point number as
    an argument.
           (hash-merge-values): Copy lists so that merged result does not
    share structure with the hash tables being merged.

1998-05-03  SL Baur  <steve@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-ootags-executable): Define br-directory, upon which it depends,
    before this definition.

Thu Apr 30 00:48:12 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-tree.el (br-tree-x-load-tree-file): Bound windowed-process-io for
    XEmacs and InfoDock under Windows.

* br-lib.el (br-insert-file-contents): Rewrote to only temporarily select
    the buffer; this leaves the temporary buffer at the bottom of the buffer
    list.
            (*br-tmp-buffer*): Make this a hidden buffer whose name begins
    with a space.

* br-c-ft.el (c++-operator-name-regexp): In whitespace match only to
    spaces since this is used only in tag files where all whitespace has
    been normalized to one space.
             (c-build-element-tags-internal): Handle operator * constructs
    where the * is dropped by ootags.

Wed Apr 29 23:56:55 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

Mon Apr 27 00:04:45 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++.el (c++-get-classes-from-source): Fixed bug that improperly
    removed comments from source buffers that were loaded into the editor
    before they were scanned by the browser.  `set-buffer' was called where
    `br-view-file-function' should have been used.

* br-c-ft.el (c++-operator-name-regexp): Added omitted + and - operators.
             (c-build-element-tags-internal): Remove all non-global scoped
    :: entries produced by ootags since the OO-Browser handles these
    separately.

==============================================================================

* OO-Browser V3.02 released.

* br-lib.el (br-find-class): Fixed to return nil if class is referenced
    but not defined in the Environment.  This fixes an error where an
    Action Key click on a referenced class does not display any message
    of failure.

* br-lib.el (br-real-add-class): Eliminated bug that would remove C++
    comments in the original buffer.

* br-lib.el (br-default-class-p): Added.
  br-env.el (br-env-totals): Rewrote to display more informative class totals.

* br-lib.el (br-merge-parents-htables): Added.

    attached twice in a computed function name which was not found and then
    funcall was used on the nil result.
            (br-real-build-parents-alist): Changed improper call of mapcar
    on a hash table to hash-map.

* br-c-ft.el (c++-function-identifier): Moved from "br-c++-ft.el" since
    is needed in this file which is recursively required by br-c++-ft.el
    when needed.
             (c-build-element-tags-internal): Modified to use explicit
    operator names so that entries like operator>>=() does not end up with

            (br-env-build): 
            (br-env-save): Used to record last build time.
	    (br-env-stats): Display build times.

* br-env.el (br-env-build): Added an (if noninteractive ...) wrapper

Tue Apr 21 17:51:51 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-java.el (java-get-parents-from-source): Fixed bug that would add
    Object as the parent of interface classes not defined within the
    Environment.  (Interfaces have no implicit parent.)

Mon Apr 20 00:44:41 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-add-class-file): Fixed bug that improperly regexp-quoted
   class-path.

==============================================================================
* V3.01 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* OO-Browser V3.00 released.

Sun Apr 19 19:15:22 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

        (br-view-entry): 
        (br-where): Modified to automatically prompt if called
    interactively when not in the OO-Browser user interface and to insert the
    defining path at point if called standalone with a prefix argument.

* br-java-ft.el (java-feature-signature-to-name): Changed class and
    feature name separator from `@' to `::'.  This makes `br-find' work
    properly for Java.

* br-ftr.el (br-element-completions): Added messages alerting user to this
    potentially long-running computation.

Sat Apr 18 02:25:15 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

    names when within the pre-argument part of a declaration or definition
    of a feature.

* br-java-ft.el (java-skip-to-statement): 
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-skip-to-statement): Modified to not move outside of a
    parenthesized grouping.  This in conjunction with the Action Key allows
    one to explore the class types associated with feature arguments, rather
    than simply jumping to the feature declaration or definition; move point
    to precede the parenthesized arguments for that.

* br.el (br-add-class-file): Modified to automatically compute whether to
    add to system or library hash tables wherever possible.

Fri Apr 17 15:28:06 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-implementors): Fixed this problem by filtering such entries:
    It is possible for a default class like [constant] to show up in a
    br-implementors listing if it contains an entry whose name is the same
    as a method.

* pyth-brows.el: Renamed from python-browse.el for 13-char filename
    compatibility.

* br-site.el: Added hook-based setting of mode-specific browser-related

    since they lack attributes and friend classes.

* br.el (br-info-language-specific): 
  br-env.el (br-env-lang-name-alist): Added to display language-specific
    manual sections.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-friend-class-regexp): Added friend classes to feature
    listings.

    `Graphical-Descendent-Features'.
    Added Concept-Manual and Menu-Manual at the top of each menu.
    Unified menu implementations so items are not repeated within the code. 

* hmouse-br.el (smart-br-assist-dispatch): 
	       (smart-br-dispatch): Removed Buffer-menu entries that
    duplicate behavior earlier in hkey-alist dispatch table.

* br-menu.el (id-menubar-br): 
             (id-popup-br-menu): Centralized graphical commands
    on a new `Graphical' menu.

* br.el (br-viewer-scroll-down-by-line): Added, bound to {,}.
	(br-viewer-scroll-up-by-line): Added, bound to {.}.

* br-java-ft.el (java-feature): Updated to more clearly inform the user
    of the location of definitions.
                (java-feature-decl-or-def): Eliminated anchor to beginning
    of line since is used with (java-skip-to-statement) which leaves point
    at the first non-blank character.

* br.el (br-find): Synched with `br-edit-entry'.
        (br-protocols): Made prefix arg of 0 toggle the setting of
    br-protocols-with-classes-flag.

* br-menu.el (id-menubar-br): 
             (id-popup-br-menu): Changed ancestor entries to do exactly
    what the keys {a} and {C-u a} do, rather than inverting the listings.
    Renamed `Where-is-Any' to `Where-is-Named'.
    Renamed `Environment/Create' to `Environment/Create-or-Load'.
    Added key binding help for virtually all menu entries.

* br-tree.el (br-tree-do-cmd): Force display in selected window if
    hpath:display-where is set to other-window; this prevents jumping the
    selected window each time a different tree entry is selected.

* tree-x/: Added ANSI-fication of C code and configure additions from
    Martin Buchholz <martin@xemacs.org>.

Tue Apr 14 16:42:07 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

    pure virtual function declarations are handled by earlier regexps.
    (c++-attribute-decl): 
    (c++-feature-decl-terminator-regexp): 
    (c++-feature-def-terminator-regexp): 
    (c++-feature-def): 
    (c++-feature-def-in-class): Added these regexp to match C++ attributes.
    (c++-scan-features-in-class): Updated to include C++ attributes.

    loaded with the current directory set to the OO-Browser code directory.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-clear-signatures): Renamed to
    br-feature-clear-tags for clarity.
            (br-feature-get-signature): Renamed to br-feature-get-tag for
    clarity.
            (br-feature-put-signatures): Renamed to br-feature-put-tags for
    clarity.

* *-browse.el (*-browse): Added (br-env-copy t) call to restore Env
    data when switching languages and returning to an Env previously
    loaded into memory.  This fixes a bug where a new Env is loaded but
    the browser still displays the classes of the previous Env because
    it still has its data loaded in memory.

* br-c-ft.el (c-build-element-tags-internal): Fix up global C++ operator tags
    which ootags doesn't format properly.

* br-compl.el (br-find-class-name): Fixed bug that ignored <> around Java
    interface names and caused br-features and br-ancestors to fail if
    invoked within the middle of an interface name.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-args-regexp): 
               (c++-func-args-regexp): 
               (c++-func-args-string): Modified to not kill the temporary
    buffer since these functions may be called frequently.  Permanent
    quitting of the browser will kill the temp buffer.

* br-lib.el (br-buffer-replace): Added optional literal-flag argument.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-normalize): 
  br-c++-ft.el: (c++-feature-normalize):

  br-ftr.el (br-feature-delete-c-comments): Added, called by above functions.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-decl-or-def): Modified to not allow : within
    function argument parentheses so that if the : following the
    parentheses within a constructor (which begins base class default
    values) includes values with parentheses, these are not matched as
    part of the parenthesized arguments.
               (c++-feature-decl-or-def): 
               (c++-feature-parens-grpn): Modified to include only

    function brace.  Also added three new named groups:
      c++-feature-post-args-grpn
      c++-feature-post-modifier-grpn
      c++-feature-defaults-grpn

* br-c++.el (c++-comment-regexp): Allow single line /* C-style */ comments 
    in signatures after each argument.  Multi-line comments are too hard
    to handle.
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-normalize): Remove C-style comments in addition to C++-style.
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-def-pat): Remove any comments before creating pat.

    sometimes omitting the last * or & of the type.
               (c++-feature-declaration-regexp): Subtracted one from
    (match-end c++-feature-type-grpn) to correct for 0-based array indexing.
               (c++-feature-signature-to-name): Fixed to extract class
    name from non-tag signatures when with-class option is used.

    (c++-feature-edit-declaration): 
    (c++-feature-view-declaration): If point is within the signature of
    a feature definition and a nil value for CLASS-AND-FEATURE is given,
    the feature's declaration is displayed.

    (c++-func-args-string): 
    (c++-feature): Support jumping between declarations and definitions
    with support for single-line C or C++-style comments between method
    arguments.
    
    (c++-func-args-string): 
    (c++-feature-args-regexp): Fixed bugs that could drop * or & from type
    declarations and that did not convert variable names followed by `='
    to regexps.

Fri Mar 20 04:26:57 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el: Modified to not load Environment after building if running in
    batch mode.

Thu Mar 19 00:14:31 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

    statements that look like method signatures, e.g. if ( ) { }

* Replaced all `fset' calls with `defalias'.

* br-lib.el (br-interface-support-p): Added.

* br-java-ft.el (java-feature-decl-or-def): Removed optionality from
    java-type-identifier expression since this must be given.  Also
    eliminated extra set of grouping characters around this expression
    and reduced half of the grouping numbers by one.

Wed Mar 18 00:00:26 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++.el (c++-header-file-regexp): Added to match to header include
    files only.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-args-regexp): Fixed bug that would drop * and
    & characters from an argument type if they were preceded by whitespace.

Tue Mar 17 23:15:40 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-at-reference-p): Added missing save-match-data
    call to prevent missing a member name in a `class::member' reference.

   information just generated in the prior pane.

* br.el (br-protocols): Changed "p" to "P" in listing buffer name to
    distinguish from parent listings.
        (br-buffer-prefix-inher): Changed from "Inher-Lvl-" to "OO-Browse-".
        (br-ancestors): Changed "p" to "a" in listing buffer name to

        (br-show-all-classes): Added and bound to {A}.

==============================================================================
* V2.13.02 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

    files to this function run after a background build finishes since the

    member-ref-regexp that broke up a standalone identifier into two
    groupings.
               (c++-feature-reference-definition): Extended to show a

	    (br-env-load): 
     	    (br-env-try-load): Modified read-file-name calls to display
   full file pathname rather than including a (default) prompt.  Also
   disallowed entry of directories (without a trailing file name).
   Displaying just the directory was inconsistent vis-a-vis whether or
   not the default was accepted.  If another directory was entered, it
   would not append the default file name to it but would signal an error.
            (br-env-get-dirs): If a non-directory is given, leave it for
   the user to correct.
            (br-env-read-file-name): Added.

* BR-README: Updated install instructions to load (rather than autoload)
    OO-Browser initializations.  That forces all of its autoload
    statements into the current editor session.  This is necessary
    when a full Hyperbole distribution is not available.

* br-env.el (br-env-batch-build-browse): Modified to automatically load
    Env if the one that just finished building in the background is the
    current Env and the browser user interface is active.

* br-ftr.el: Fixed Emacs 19 conditional that did not handle version 20.
    This made the feature listing signature code use the slower version 18
    style.

* br.el (br-browse): Fixed conditional bug that showed a compilation
    process running when it had actually exited.
        (br-window-setup): Updated to leave point in the first window.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-variable-declaration): Handle declarations
    where variable name is followed by an =, *, or & character.
               (c++-feature-method-declaration): Added.
	       (c++-feature-view-declaration): Display a method
    declaration even if there is no definition for it in the Environment
    (this ignores overloading).
               (c++-feature-def-p): Fixed test ordering bug that caused
    this to fail most of the time.

* br-clos-ft.el (clos-skip-to-statement): Fixed so only moves if on the
    first line of a definition.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-view-declaration): Show definitions of
    [default class] features rather than giving an error since a user may
    invoke this command on them thinking he can jump to them.
               (c++-feature-at-reference-p): 
               (c++-feature-variable-class): Updated to handle `this'
    pseudo-variable.

* br-java-ft.el (java-feature-def-p):
                (java-feature): 
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-def-p):
                (objc-feature): 
  br-c++-ft.el  (c++-feature-def-p)
                (c++-view-friend): 
                (c++-feature): Updated to display feature definitions only
    when point is within a declaration signature and not the
    brace-delimited body part.  This allows Action Key presses
    on method bodies defined within classes to do other things.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-default): Added.
            (br-feature-complete): Improved defaults in OO-Browser listing
    buffers and code buffers.
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-view-declaration): Improved default and
    added a minibuffer message telling the user the class of the feature
    declaration just displayed since this may not be visible on screen.

Wed Jan 14 22:51:15 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-def-pat): 
               (c++-feature-declaration-regexp): Fixed regexp-related bugs
    and improper side-effect that lost [*&] chars when immediately
    preceding the member name.  Also fixed bug where member-type was
    regexp-quoted but then used as a literal.

* V2.12.04 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Tue Jan 13 00:14:03 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-vers.el (br-version): Updated to "02.12.03".

* br-init.el (br-after-term-init): Added internal hkey-value variable,
    completion and direct selection of many entities.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-tag-name): Added.

* br-python-ft.el (python-feature-normalize): 
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-normalize): 
  br-java-ft.el (java-feature-normalize): 
  br-clos-ft.el (clos-feature-normalize): 
  br-c+++-ftr.el (c++-feature-normalize): Fixed bug that allowed multiple
    spaces in tag entries whose original signatures contained comments.
    This could cause Implementors matching to fail.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-signature-to-name): Added clause to handle
    source code signature forms.

* br-lib.el (br-setup-functions): Added generic br-feature-normalize.
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-normalize): 
  br-clos-ft.el (clos-feature-normalize): Adjusted to multi-language 3 arg
    calling convention.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-insert-signatures): Renamed from br-feature-insert-tags.
  br-lib.el (br-feature-list-implementors): Modified to display classes
    above each set of signatures and to display only the part of tags that
    come from the source code itself for easier reading.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-tag-signature): Added.
  br-lib.el (br-setup-constants): Added br-tag-fields-regexp so can
    extract source code signatures from tag entries in any language.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-attribute-display): 
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-variable-class):
	(c++-feature-reference-definition): Added above functions and
    called from here to determine the class of a variable used in a member
    reference like var->method() or var.attribute.  Only works if variable
    type is specified within the current file before point.  Also used to
    display the definition of the variable.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-complete): Greatly improved default prompt under C++.

* br.el (br-mode-map): Bound {j} to br-feature-view-declaration and
    {J} to br-feature-edit-declaration.
  br-lib.el (br-setup-functions): Added generic br-feature-view-declaration
    and br-feature-edit-declaration.
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-args-regexp): 
	(c++-feature-declaration-regexp): 
	(c++-feature-edit-declaration):
	(c++-feature-view-declaration): Added to edit or view C++ method declarations.

* br.el (br-view): Modified to only kill previous viewer buffer if
    successfully find the entry to view.

* eif-calls.el (eif-get-features-from-source): 
  br-ftr.el (br-feature-signature): 
  br-python-ft.el (python-list-features): 
              	  (python-feature-matches): 
  br-java-ft.el (java-scan-features): 
  br-clos-ft.el (clos-scan-features): 
  br.el (br-lexical-features): 
        (br-this-level-features): 
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-list-features): Removed local binding of `features'
    which mistakenly overroad the global variable by the same name.  This
    caused no package names to be defined which sometimes resulted in
    improperly loading packages unnecessarily that had already been
    loaded.  Under InfoDock when {F} was used under C++ in a listing
    buffer and the signatures buffer had not been created, a setting of
    c++-mode-hook from site-var.el caused a reloading of site-func.el
    which loaded buff-menu and several other files, delaying the execution
    of the command significantly.

==============================================================================
* V2.12.03 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Fri Jan  9 01:03:16 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-init.el (br-after-term-init): Added clauses to the hkey-alist
    included with the OO-Browser to support Action Key clicks within C,
    C++, Java, Lisp and Objective-C buffers (previously these clauses were
    only included with Hyperbole distributions).
             (br-init-autoloads): Added hmouse-tag.el entries.

* br-env.el (br-env-build): Modified so that when build in the background,
    and buffers with attached Env files that will be overwritten are
    killed before the build is started.  This avoids any `file
    changed on disk messages' when the files are reloaded.

* br.el (br-browse): Modified to display compilation buffer showing
    background Environment build if one is running when the browser
    is invoked.

* br-env.el (br-env-batch-build-browse): Updated to force load of just
    built Environment before trying to browse it and to reinitialize
    the browser display.

* br-compl.el (br-complete-type): Improved filtering of entries.

Thu Jan  8 12:38:53 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-completions): Renamed to br-element-completions
    and used this prior name to provide feature-only completions (no
    entries from default classes).
            (br-element-tags-completions): Added.

* br.el (br-in-view-window-p): Fixed to ignore an active minibuffer window.

* br-lib.el (br-empty-htable): Added and used in language-specific
    *-browse functions.

* br-env.el (br-env-browse): Interactively use directory of br-env-file as
    initial contents when specifying a new Environment filename.

* *-brows*.el (*-browse): Improved handling of the case where the user
     aborts within the middle of loading an Environment.  This used to cause
     the -FTR file name to not be updated to the new value if it appeared
     that the same Env was being loaded a second time but it never
     completed initialization the first time.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-name-to-regexp): Rewrote to work properly with br-find.
  br-ftr.el (br-feature-completions): Removed for-display option sent to
    br-feature-signature-to-name which improperly prefixed each feature name.

* br-start.el (hyperb:dir): Set this variable used by functions in hypb/ subdirectory.

==============================================================================
* V2.12.02 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Wed Jan  7 13:19:02 1998  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el (br-env-load): Eliminated confusing message about Env file not
    existing when creating a new Env.
            (br-env-create): Clarified messages that begin Env
    specification and which prompt for search directories.
            (br-env-stats): Clarified headings.

* br.el (br-cleanup): Cleared current lang env-file variable when use {C-u
    q} to prevent any use of cached data if reload the same Environment again.
  br-env.el (br-env-add-ref-classes): Rewrote to avoid infinite recursion
    when reload the previous Environment after a {C-u q} exit.

* br-init.el (hkey-alist): Added call to smart-element.
             (br-after-term-init): Removed no-op condition when hypb/ was
    already in the load-path.
             (br-init-autoloads): Added Info-goto-node autoload.

* hmouse-br.el (smart-element): Added (renamed from oobr-ftr in hibtypes.el).

* br-menu.el (br-popup-menu): Fixed to deal with GNU Emacs
    definition of popup-menu as a macro.

* br-start.el (br-directory): Simplified by using locate-file instead of
    hyperb:path-being-loaded.

	     (id-popup-br-menu): Added "Protocols" and "All-Protocols" items.
	                         Added "Implementors" and "All-Implementors"
    to class menus.
  br.el (br-protocols): Added error if current language does not support
    protocol browsing.

                (objc-feature-map-tags): 
  br-c++-ft.el  (c++-list-features): 
                (c++-feature-map-tags): 
                (c++-feature-map-class-tags): Made case-sensitive.

* br.el (br-interfaces): Aliased to br-protocols for Java-centricity.

* br-compl.el (br-find-class-name): Updated to handle Objective-C listing
    entries of (category) only.
  br.el (br-implementors): Don't sort entries for which implementors are
    requested; this can be visually confusing.
	(br-implementors): Updated to handle Objective-C categories.
* br-objc-ft.el (objc-list-category-classes): Added to support br-implementors.

Sun Dec 21 00:14:39 1997  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el (br-env-load): Obsoleted Java and Objective-C Environments
    earlier than "02.12".

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-type-regexp): Removed `@' character since it is no
    longer used to preface category and protocol/interface entries (they
    have no prefix since they are now displayed and treated like classes).

    clause which mistakenly had not been locally bound.

* br-lib.el (br-find-class): Modified to leave point at the start of the
    class definition rather than at the start of any preceding comments.
    The comments still appear at the top of the window, however.

Sat Dec 20 22:46:41 1997  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-java.el (java-to-comments-begin):
  br-objc.el (objc-to-comments-begin):
  br-c++.el (c++-to-comments-begin):   Set to br-c-to-comments-begin.
  br-lib.el (br-c-to-comments-begin): Added, used for C-derived languages.
    Made to ignore comments that do not begin a line, e.g. @end /* comment */.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-decl-or-def): Extended to allow for final
    , ... syntax.
                (objc-find-class-name): Updated to surround protocol names
    inherited by class or protocol definitions with <> delimiters.
                (objc-to-definition):
  br-java-ft.el (java-to-definition): 
  br-c++-ft.el  (c++-to-definition): Reordered tests to allow selection

* java-brows.el (java-class-list-filter): 
  objc-brows.el (objc-class-list-filter): Rewrote to deal with top-level
    classes which may inherit from abstract classes that don't count.

* br-lib.el (br-flatten): Added to flatten multi-level lists.

* *-brows*.el (*-class-list-filter): Rebound by default to br-class-list-identity.
  br-lib.el (br-class-list-identity): Added.


* br.el (br-at-class-category-p): Added.
        (br-show-classes): Renamed from br-show-top-classes since is also
    used to show all classes.

* br.el (br-match):             
  br-compl.el (br-class-completions): Deleted call to br-class-list-filter
    since we want to be able to match to any concrete or abstract class.

* br-help: Added {P} key binding description for showing protocols to
    which a class conforms.

* br.el (br-implementors): Changed to insert implementors in next listing
    window instead of the previous one since implementors are sometimes
    descendants of the entry, e.g. implementors of an abstract class.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-class-definition-regexp): Fixed to differentiate
    between classes and protocols.
                (objc-feature-map-tags): Fixed to handle ^ and $
    meta-characters which in turn made br-implementors work when on
    a feature entry.

* br-objc.el (objc-get-classes-from-source): 
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-list-protocols): Rewrote to use new scheme for
    recording protocol entries as <classes>.
                (objc-view-protocol): 
* br-java-ft.el (java-view-protocol): Deleted, normal {v} command now works.

* br.el (br-protocols): Rewrote to display abstract classes (protocols)
    within ancestor inheritance lattices.  Removed display of protocol
    definition when this command is used on a protocol; now one can use
    {v} or {e} to view protocols.

    from listing buffers.
            (br-concrete-class-p): Added, inverse of br-interface-p.

        (br-ancestor-trees-inverted): 
        (br-ancestor-trees): Added final concrete-classes-flag to limit
    display to non-abstract ancestors only.

    category entries as classes so that their features are displayed
    when all features for a listing buffer are requested via {C-u f}.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-scan-protocol-signatures): Added.
  br-objc.el (objc-get-classes-from-source): Updated to include protocol
    method signature tags for browsing.

* br-java-ft.el (java-feature-implementors): 
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-implementors): Updated to ignore protocol
    method signatures since they are not implementations.

Wed Dec 17 00:28:05 1997  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-lib.el (br-add-default-classes): Centralized this code for use by
    many languages.

Tue Dec 16 18:35:42 1997  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* java-brows.el (java-browse-setup): 
  br-java.el (java-get-classes-from-source): 
  br-java-ft.el (java-view-protocol): 
                (java-list-protocols):
                (java-add-default-classes): 
                (java-default-interface-class): 
  br-compl.el (br-find-class-name):
  br.el (br-at-protocol-p): Added support for delimited Java <interfaces>.

* br.el (br-ancestor-trees-inverted): 
	(br-ancestor-trees): Fixed test which was reversed, of when to show
    previously expanded ellipses indicator for an entry.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-descendant-implementors): Added.
            (br-feature-put-signatures): Fixed so signature properties
    are not copied to other buffers.

* br-java-ft.el (java-feature-add-prefix): Fixed bug that miscategorized
    interface method declarations (which are all implicitly abstract) as
    attributes rather than implicit methods.

* br-ftr.el (br-edit-feature-from-tag): Fixed bug that caused non-nil
    return when feature was not found and function was called
    non-interactively.
            (br-feature-ancestor-implementors): Added extensive error
    reporting and a description of how to correct the problem when an
    Environment includes an invalid feature definition pathname.
            (br-feature-ancestor-implementors): Added a user message
    when a single definition of a method is found.

Wed Dec 10 18:06:51 1997  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature): Removed test of whether in a header file
    since some programmers define classes within .cc code files.  The
    old test was:
     (if (string-match "[^.]\\.\\([hH][hHxX]?[pPxX]?\\)\\'" (buffer-name)) ...)
    Tightened test for declarations to allow them only if point is within
    a class definition.

* br-menu.el (id-popup-br-menu): 
	     (id-menubar-br): Fixed bug renaming `br-class-info' to `br-entry-info'.

Thu Nov 20 00:57:16 1997  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-init.el (br-skip-dir-regexps): Added skip of CVS subdirectories.

    c++-class-decl-p to keep it from moving point.
               (c++-feature): Modified to notice declarations and
	       definitions within header files only.  This prevents
	       falsing on in-body constructs that look like member
	       constructs, like if (...) { ...

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-display-implementors): 
	    (br-feature-list-implementors): Added to support browsing of
    element implementors.

* br-lib.el (br-find-file): Updated to use Hyperbole hpath:display-buffer

    are built exactly once when only the System or Library parts of an
    Environment are rebuilt or when the whole Environment is rebuilt.
    Did this in part by changing the format of the last line of the
    OOBR-FTR tags file to include the file position where the C construct
    tags begin, so that it may be replaced each time necessary.

* Makefile (HYPB_EL/C): Added hypb/hmouse-tag whose smart tag
    functions may be called in C-based languages when the Action Key

    be in the OO-Browser.  This could eliminate a problem that prevents

                (java-cpp-include-dirs): 
		(java-include-regexp): 
                (java-include-file): Deleted this stuff which never
    should have been here, since Java doesn't use includes per se.
                (java-code-file-regexp): Added support for 3-character
    suffix-impaired users.
                (java-feature-def-pat): Eliminated unneeded C++ carryover logic.

    tag lookup by specifying class and feature name as separate arguments.

* br-java-ft.el (java-feature-signature-to-name): Modified to use
    java-type-tag-separator instead of "." as a separator between the class
    and feature name, since this caused a failure when tried to do
    completion on feature names with br-feature-complete.
                (java-tag-fields-regexp): Made final occurrence of
    java-type-tag-separator optional since it is not included if the
    regexp came from a completion.

* br-ftr.el (br-edit-feature-from-tag): Renamed from `br-edit-feature' so
    can reuse that name with a simpler set of arguments.

Wed Oct 30 19:50:34 1996  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-lib.el (br-add-class): 
            (br-real-add-class): Fixed bug that did not add features of a
    class when br-add-class was called interactively.  Added the
    optional add-features argument to handle this.

* br-java-ft.el (java-return-type-identifier): Fixed bug that neglected
    to allow the open square bracket of an array return identifier and
    thus caused the scanner to miss methods with such return values.

Tue Oct 22 23:16:02 1996  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* tree-x/intf.c (InitializeInterface): Renabled use of backing store
    in DBLcreate_double_buffer call to eliminate nasty bug on some

Sat Oct 21 02:02:27 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c-tags (tags_file): Fixed bug that erased first comma in a structure
    or enum entries, preventing the browser from displaying the source for
    such entries.

* br-init.el (br-after-term-init): Changed call of `hmouse-setup' to
    `hmouse-shift-buttons' which fixes bug of mouse keys not being

* eif-browse.el (eif-browse): 
* clos-brows.el (clos-browse):
* c++-browse.el (c++-browse):

    alert him with a message that the Environment must be built before
    browsing.

* br-env.el (br-env-create): Modified to allow background builds when
    re-specify current Environment and to only build the Environment if
    called interactively.

    to just try to load Environment once, instead of looping, so user can
    easily quit.
            (br-env-init): Modified to return Env file name loaded or nil
    if load fails.

* br-c++.el (c++-src-file-regexp): Ellemtel C++ recommendations specify

    encourage people to recognize the real name of the package.  Also
    reversed meaning of the prefix argument so that by default, it always
    prompts for the Environment to browse, thereby removing a common
    problem new users have of not being able to specify the Environment
    location.  Immediately hitting {RET} when prompted browses the most
    recently browsed Environment, if any.

Wed Sep 13 11:21:17 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* man/oo-browser.texi (Customization): Documented br-skip-dir-regexps and
    br-file-dir-regexp variables.

    Mail-List-Request entries.

	       (c++-func-args-string): Modified to add optional spaces
    between a C++ type and `*' or `&' characters since the spacing
    sometimes varies between declaration and definition, e.g. declaration
    is "func(const List<T>&);" and def is "func(const List<T> &id) {}".

* br-ftr.el (br-edit-feature): Added to jump to feature when tag-entry and
    file of feature def have already been computed.

* tree-x: Replaced the old Motif X OO-Browser with the new Xt-based one.

* br-tree.el (br-tree-do-cmd): Fixed bug that could cause
    br-feature-tree-command-p to be invoked in languages for which it is not
    defined.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-locate-p): Fixed so if try to browse method2
    from class2 which is defined after method1 of class1 in the same file,
    and method1 and method2 have the same name, it works.  Previously, the
    class in which the method was defined was ignored under Objective-C.

* br.el (br-children): 
        (br-parents): 
	(br-ancestors)
	(br-descendants): When applied to a single class, eliminated narrow
   of listing to that class.  Instead insert class in output listing, just
   like when applied to a whole listing.  This also makes producing
   graphical displays of a listing simpler.

Sat Mar  4 14:38:45 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-list-categories): 
  	        (objc-list-protocols): Added to support category and
  protocol browsing.
* br-lib.el (br-setup-functions): Added per-language "list-features" and
    "list-protocols" functions.

Fri Mar  3 14:00:24 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-mode-map): Added {C} = br-categories and {P} = br-protocols.
        (br-categories): Added to show class categories.
        (br-protocols): Added to show protocols to which a class conforms.

* br-lib.el (br-real-add-class): Trigger error if class-name is nil or if
    replace is attempted on a non-existent class.

* br.el (br-features): Modified so if no feature definitions for the class
   in the Environment, then browse feature declarations by displaying the
   class definition.

* br-compl.el (br-class-completions): 
  br.el (br-show-top-classes):
        (br-match): Added (br-class-list-filter classes) so each language
    can filter the set of classes listed when showing top classes or
    matching to class names.  Set this language-specific function to
    'identity for all languages except Objective-C where protocols and
    class categories are filtered out.

Fri Mar  3 02:03:42 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-lib.el (br-real-build-al)
    (br-search-directory): Modified scanning message to lead with
    last path component in case long paths in the minibuffer would
    otherwise obscure it.

* br-objc-ft.el
  br-objc.el
  objc-brows.el: Numerous changes to support category and protocol browsing.

Thu Mar  2 00:16:49 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-interrupt):
        (br-quit):       Added test to ensure that are in the OO-Browser
    within the selected frame before interrupting.

* br-c++-ft.el (c++-list-features): 
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-list-features): Fixed bug where 2nd and 3rd search
    args were reversed.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-type-regexp): Added this constant to match to
    leading character of an OO-Browser feature listing.
* br-ftr.el (br-feature-entry): 
  br-compl.el (br-find-class-name):
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-signature-to-regexp):
    Used this new constant.

* br.el (br-sort-options): Added to control the way listing buffers are sorted.

Wed Mar  1 10:40:54 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-compl.el (br-all-classes): Rewrote to omit sort in most cases, since
    many functions that call this will do their own sorting.

* br-lib.el (br-class-path): Made this return nil if class-path is equal
    to br-null-path.

* br.el: Redefined and rebound these commands to be more representative of
  what they now do, considering that class features may now be other
  things than just routines and that {f} and {F} will now list feature
  names and feature tags respectively.
	OLD-NAME      NEW-NAME                   OLD-KEY  NEW-KEY
	=========================================================
	br-find       Use br-edit-entry instead.         {C-u e}
	br-routines   br-features                   r       f

Tue Feb 28 10:11:04 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* hasht.el (hash-length):
           (hash-size): Changed these 2 functions to return size of the
    hash-table structure rather than number of elements.
           (hash-count): Added this to return number of elements in hash-table.

* br-clos-ft.el (clos-element-tag-list): Renamed from `clos-element-tag' and
    changed to return a list of tags since one method definition may
    generate features in many classes.

* hasht.el (hash-copy):      Added to copy first level of a hash table.
           (hash-deep-copy): Added to copy all levels of a hash table.
    Redesigned internal data structure so can tell hash tables from
    vectors, so that copy routines know how to copy symbol values from the
    hash table obarray.

Sun Feb 26 17:03:37 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* man/oo-browser.texi (Browsing Implementors): 
                (Browsing Elements): Added these two sections.

Sat Feb 25 12:10:29 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-find): Added support for CLOS element lookup.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-signature-to-name): Fixed bug that prevented
    class name from being included when with-class option is given.

* br-init.el (br-skip-dir-regexps): Added skip of SCCS subdirectories and
    made this a user variable.

* Makefile: Changed so that elc target just rebuilds out of date elc
  files, not all elc files.  all-elc now does that.

Fri Feb 24 17:19:37 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-compl.el (br-buffer-menu): Rewrote to handle case where filename is
    stripped from path listed under File section in Buffer-menu.  Use
    buffer names instead.  Slower, but correct in more cases.

Thu Feb 23 10:51:53 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* man/oo-browser.texi (Glossary): Added a number of OO terms.

* br-ftr.el (br-feature-get-signature): Changed to return nil when no
    feature signature is found, instead of "".

* br.el (br-this-level-features): Modified to list features only, not classes.

* br.el (br-implementors): 
  br-c++-ft.el (c++-feature-implementors): 
  br-clos-ft.el (clos-feature-implementors): 
  br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-implementors): Changed to support browsing
    implementor feature from each class.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-implementors): 
  	        (objc-feature-matches): Fixed these functions so that
    br-implementors works properly for Objective-C.

Wed Feb 22 14:31:55 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-lib.el (br-build-lib-htable): Added (run-hooks 'br-after-build-lib-hook).
            (br-build-sys-htable): Added (run-hooks 'br-after-build-sys-hook).
    This allows language-specific actions which add to library and system
    classes after the source code has been scanned, e.g. to add categories
    as classes.
  br-clos-ft.el:  Used above hook to add element category classes to system
    classes, since the elements in these classes change as the system
    evolves.

Tue Feb 21 14:38:47 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-tree.el
  man/oo-browser.texi
  br-help
  br.el (br-mode-map): Renamed `br-tree-routines-toggle' to
    `br-tree-features-toggle' and moved key binding from {M-r} to {M-f}.
    Renamed `br-show-routines' to `br-show-features'.

* *.el: Changed all -ftr- to -feature-.
* br*[fr]t.el: Clarified many symbol names within these files.

* br-clos-ft.el
  br-clos-rt.el: Added these 2 files to support feature browsing in CLOS
    and BWlib, my own object system which looks like CLOS.

Fri Feb 17 00:12:37 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-objc-rt.el (objc-scan-routines-in-class): 
* br-c++-rt.el  (c++-scan-routines-in-class): Fixed bug that failed to save
    normalized form of routine for return.

Mon Feb 13 11:18:46 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

Sun Feb 12 16:09:29 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-clos.el (clos-src-file-regexp): Updated to scan .el files, so
    will-read CLOS-like definitions in Emacs Lisp code.  Normal CLOS code
    directories will not contain any such code, so will not be affected.

Thu Feb  9 13:19:38 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* hasht.el (hash-make): Modified to accept an integer as the first
    argument, meaning create an empty hash table with that minimum size.

Mon Jan  9 12:00:40 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++.el (c++-in-c-comment-p):
            (c++-to-comments-begin): Fixed to avoid treating //*** comments
    as multi-line comments.

* br-env.el (br-env-copy): Changed `intern-soft' to `intern' to avert bug
    that appears when try to set an as yet undefined symbol.

Tue Jan  3 16:49:44 1995  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-c++.el (c++-src-file-regexp): Modified to handle .cpp and .hpp
    suffixes used by someone on OS/2.

Wed Dec 21 16:30:27 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-mouse.el
  MAKE-DIST
  br-load.lsp:  Removed these files which are no longer needed.

* BR-README: Added install directive which autoloads br-env-browse, so can
    be used to initialize the OO-Browser.
* br-init.el (br-after-term-init2): Added autoload of br-env-browse and
    add of oo-browser/hypb/ directory to load-path when full Hyperbole
    system is not available.

* br-env.el (br-env-browse): Added this function to invoke the appropriate
    language OO-Browser given an Environment as an argument.  This can be
    used to support OO-Browser invocation by mouse clicking on Env file
    names.

Fri Dec 16 19:58:24 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-init.el (br-after-term-init2): Changed so menus are only loaded under
    XEmacs-based InfoDock.

Thu Dec 15 22:26:15 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

    calls to suppress compiler warnings.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-func-args-regexp): 
                (objc-func-args-string): 
  br-c++-ft.el  (c++-func-args-regexp): 
                (c++-func-args-string): Fixed replacement of spaces so that
    clicking on a declaration in a .h file jumps to the associated
    definition in a source file.

Thu Dec 15 12:37:31 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* tree-x/intf.c: Rewrote to handle X displays of varying sizes.

* br-objc-ft.el (objc-feature-def-pat): 
  br-c++-ft.el  (c++-feature-def-pat): Rewrote to simplify and to eliminate
    call to read-from-string, which may be unreliable in this usage.

* tree-x/input.c (GetNextToken): Changed `char c' to `int c', otherwise,
    cannot detect EOF and all possible chars.

Fri Dec  9 18:05:50 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-objc-rt.el (objc-routine-normalize): Rewrote to reduce strings of
    spaces to one space.
                (objc-ftr-def-pat): For each space, match to 0 or more
    spaces.

* br-c++-rt.el  (c++-routine-normalize): Rewrote to reduce strings of
    spaces to one space.
                (c++-ftr-def-pat):  For each space, match to 0 or more
    spaces.  Also modified to match to routines which have
    a // comment following each argument, e.g.
    UI_EnmField::Fill_internal
    (
      Field_value__front_end_internal * field_msg,  // Data area to read from
      int                             & amount_taken   // Amount we read
    )
  {
  }

* br-env.el (br-env-force-load): Fixed paren bug which caused use of wrong
    file name for Envir when default was accepted.

Thu Dec  1 13:44:25 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el: br-listing-window-p
	 br-non-listing-window-p - Added these predicate macros to centralize
   testing for browser window types.

* br.el: Modified handling of br-in-browser variable to account for FSF Emacs
    19 and XEmacs multi-frame capabilities.
* br-init.el: Added conditional definition for selected-frame.

* BR-README: Updated installation and build directions.
* Makefile:  Added HYPERBOLE mouse support file dependencies and changed
    `dist' target so it actually produces a standalone tar file
    distribution of the OO-Browser.

==============================================================================
* V2.8 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Mon Oct 24 21:28:09 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* Makefile: Added for automated building of the OO-Browser.  See the
    documentation at the top of this file for instructions on usage.

Sun Oct 23 20:28:37 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-lib.el (br-relative-path): Added so that relative pathnames do not
    come out longer than absolute ones.

Sun Oct 23 15:45:28 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el (br-env-select-lang): Added popup-dialog box for language
    selection under XEmacs when command is invoked via the mouse.

Wed Oct 19 18:21:45 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-env.el (br-env-lang-var): Changed Environment file name from:
    (concat br-env-dir ".br-" lang-prefix "env")
    to "OOBR".
            (br-env-default-file): Added to compute default Env file.
    Modified other br-env.el functions to use this function.

* br-ftr.el (br-ftr-tags-init): Changed br-ftr-tags-file from using "-m"
    suffix to using "-FTR" suffix.

Wed Sep 21 14:52:39 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-ftr.el (br-ftr-found-p): Fixed bug that could cause return value of
    nil when feature was found and source file of feature definition was
    read from disk the first time.

Wed Sep 21 11:45:26 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el (br-mode): Added (run-hooks 'br-mode-hook).

Wed Mar 30 21:07:37 1994  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

    information which followed the parameter list, e.g. function() const.

* br-lib.el (br-real-delete-class): Fixed bug in call to hash-replace.
            (br-major-mode): Added and replaced calls to br-lang-mode with
    this, which only sets the mode if it is not set already.

* c++-browse.el (c++-browse-setup): Added conditional for cc-mode, new
    name for C++ mode under Emacs.

Thu Aug 19 21:05:00 1993  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br-lib.el:   Fixed `br-real-build-alists-br' to not erase routine tags file
    when called.  This would lead to an empty routine file if sys paths had
    methods but lib paths was built after and it did not have methods.
  br-env.el:   Updated `br-env-build' to delete br-ftr-tags-file and its
    buffer before doing build since is no longer done in `br-real-build-alist-br'.

Sat Apr 24 15:29:46 1993  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

*  br-xbr.el:  Renamed to br-tree.el.

     (let ((inhibit-local-variables nil))
   to prevent setting from prompting user when files are read in.

Mon Dec 24 07:21:37 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

* br.el:  Modified (br-help) to remove local keymap so normal movement
	   commands work within help buffers.

==============================================================================
V2.6 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

Thu Dec 20 19:04:32 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br.el, br-lib.el, br-init.el:  Added full support for use of non-Emacs
      browser viewers and editors.  All such tools are handled as
      sub-processes, so they can be kill off through the Emacs interface if
      desired.

** br.el: Added (br-toggle-keep-viewed) bound to {C-c v} to keep/not keep
     all viewed buffers in memory.  Default is to keep only last one.

** br.el: Modified (br-match) so it allows repeated filtering of class lists to
   hone in on desired classes.

** br-xtree.el:  Renamed to br-xbr.el.

Wed Dec 19 15:24:55 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br-xtree.el:  Added support for multiple simultaneous xtree browsing
     sessions and optimized context time maximally when outside of
     OO-Browser UI and pretty well when in UI (just have to sort
     classes in order to display).

Mon Dec 17 01:16:49 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br.el:  Added {H} (br-help-ms) command to display mouse help.
   br-lib.el: Added `br-keep-viewed-classes' flag which if nil
     deletes each class file as a new one is viewed.  By default, is nil.
     t value leaves viewed classes around for further manipulation.

Wed Oct 17 22:12:00 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br.el:  Improved ordering of large class lists by using UNIX "sort".

Mon Oct 15 01:26:56 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** eif-calls.el:  br-info-class did not work since `eif-try-for-routine-call'
     used the wrong parameters for string matching.  Fixed.

Sat Oct  6 15:12:36 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br-eif-ft.el:  Created this file.  Allows selection of a feature name in a
     class export clause and moves point to feature definition if within the
     same source file.  Also goes to class def when class name is selected.

Mon Oct  1 18:13:46 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** hash.el: Removed sorting of value elements in `hash-make' function.
   br-eif.el: Sorted class list elements in `eif-real-build-paths-alist'.
   br-lib.el: Removed list reversal from `br-real-build-parents-alist'
     and `br-real-build-alists-br'.
     Sorted each set of classes in path list construction in
     `br-real-build-al'.
   These changes fixed display of parents so that they are listed in the same
     order as they are in the source file.

** br-env.el: Eliminated use of `br-use-children-htable'; now assume always
     true. This option added virtually no value.

Wed Sep 26 14:07:34 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br.el: Fixed `br-narrow-to-class' to work with info-browse class names.
          Added error handling into `br-view' for when class which is
	  referenced but not defined in environment is selected.

** br-env.el:  Modified `br-env-set-htables' function to add class
     names that are referenced but not defined into the library part of the
     environment.

Tue Sep 25 13:22:57 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br-c++-ft.el:  Added `c++-include-dirs' variable used to set extra include
     directories to search.

** br-c++-ft.el:  Created this file.  Allows selection of a class declaration
     within a class definition and moves point to member definition if within a
     file in the same directory.  Handles overloading but not inherited members
     yet.  Also goes to class def when class name is selected.

** br-info.el:
   info-brows.el:  Added these two files, allows hierarchical browsing,
     searching of sets of Info manuals.

**  br-lib.el:
    br.el:      Modified `br-view' and `br-find-class' slightly to accomodate
      special needs of the Info browser.

** br-clos.el:
   clos-brows.el:
   br-smt.el
   smt-browse.el:  Tested and added CLOS and Smalltalk browser support.

Fri Sep 21 00:26:17 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br.el:  Stored current window line in `*br-level-hist*' in order to make
    `br-exit-level' position all lines in buffer exited to, exactly as they
    were before.

** br.el:  Switched default at browser startup `br-browse' and when refresh
     screen `br-refresh' or rebuild environments `br-sys-rebuild' and
    `br-lib-rebuild' to display all classes rather than just the top-level
    classes as they did before.  This prevents novice confusion over where his
    classes are and allows easier access to all users.

Tue Sep 18 16:37:59 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br-c++.el:  Fixed def of `c++-identifier' to allow `~' as first identifier
     character to account for destructor functions.

** br.el:  Added `br-interrupt' function.  Is used by `br-quit' and
     `br-view-full-screen' to bury all browser buffers. 

Fri Sep 14 03:04:31 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br-c++.el:  Kept from matching translated C source files that end in ..[cC].

** br-init.el:  Made browser Lisp files autoload when needed, so eliminated
     conditional flags which enabled each language, e.g. `br-use-eif'.
     Put browser invocation key bindings at top of file so user can easily
     change them.

Mon Sep  3 16:32:16 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br-mouse.el:  Modified `smart-br' to display browser help when a blank class
     listing buffer is clicked in.
     Added `smart-br-cmd-select' function.  Make note in user manual that
     messages will disappear from minibuffer once release the mouse button
     under some window systems, to see message, simply hold the button down
     until you have read the message.

** br-init.el: Changed `br-mouse-setup' to use `smart-key-mouse' rather than
     `smart-key' under SunView and Apollo DM.

** br.el: Changed `br-help' function so that it uses `br-mode' as the major
     mode for the browser help buffer.  This is necessary to support the direct
     selection of commands from the help buffer.

Sat Sep  1 19:49:25 1990  Bob Weiner  <weiner@beopen.com>

** br.el: Made `br-mode' function interactive.

** br-mouse.el: Fixed so would work properly with X windows.  Changed
     `smart-key' and `smart-key-meta' so they take a single optional arg
     list rather than individual args that end up grouped into a list.
     This works better for X and is unused by most other window systems.

** br-init.el: Made setup of mouse control of browser automatic for X,
     SunView and Apollo DM.



* Changes for version 1.2.4

** Fixed problem with `br-add-class-file' in "br.el" that set
     children-htable values improperly.

** Modified `br-find-class' in "br-lib.el" in the case when
    `br-narrow-view-to-class' is set to nil.  Previously, it just moved
    point to the beginning of the file in which the desired class was found.
    Now places point at the start of the class.

** Changed default value of `<lang>-narrow-view-to-class' to nil for all
     languages.


* Changes for version 1.2.3

** Changed all filenames to be 14 or fewer chars.


* Changes for version 1.2.2, from 1.2.1

Wed Jul 25 1990  Bob Weiner    <weiner@beopen.com>

** Fixed `br-where' bound to {w} in "br.el" so when called with a prefix
     argument, displays class path properly.

** Added (require 'compile) to "eif-ise-er.el" so that key definition in
     compile would not override eif-ise-er definition of {C-x `} when library
     was autoloaded.  Without this change, error parsing failed the first time
     it was invoked in each Emacs session.

** Added `eiffel-find-feature' and `eif-find-feature' to "br-eif.el".  Not yet
     bound to keys, more work must be done in order to do this.

** Changed get parents code in Eiffel to support comments between class
     names in `inherit' clause (also changed `eif-parent-regexp' for same
     reason).
