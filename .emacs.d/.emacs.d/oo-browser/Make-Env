# DESCRIPTION:  
#
# USAGE:  Called from "br-env.el".  Do not try to call any targets in here
#         by hand unless you understand how to set things up by hand.
#
#         make -f Env-Make oo-browser-env
#   or
#         make -f Env-Make oo-browser-env-debug
#
#   The latter target is for debugging background building.

# want to use to byte-compile Lisp files.

# Site-specific Emacs Lisp libraries to load before byte-compiling any files
# from this package.  Typically the only reason to set this is to get Emacs
# to include the directory of this package into its load-path variable, which
# determines where it will find Lisp library files to load.
#
# InfoDock and XEmacs 19.12 or higher include this package and automatically
# add its directory to load-path.  Under Emacs 19, if you add this directory
# to load-path in your site-lisp/site-start.el file, then you need not change
# this setting since site-start is automatically loaded whenever Emacs starts
# up.  If, however, you set load-path in your personal ~/.emacs file, you
# must add that to this setting.
#
# You must include the .el or .elc file suffix on each library name and each
# must be preceded by the `-l ' command-line flag.  If the directory in which
# the library is stored will not be in your Emacs load-path when Emacs
# attempts to load the library, you must include the full pathname to the
# library.  Here is an example setting.
